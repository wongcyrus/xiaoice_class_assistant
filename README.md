# LangBridge Presenter

A comprehensive system for integrating AI digital human interactions into classrooms and presentations. It consists of a serverless backend on Google Cloud Platform and client applications for real-time context monitoring.

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation for each component can be found in the `docs/` directory:

- **[System Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: High-level overview of the system, data flow, and security.
- **[Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Step-by-step guide to deploying the full stack (Backend & Web Client).
- **[Backend Documentation](docs/BACKEND.md)**: Details on Cloud Functions, API Gateway, and Infrastructure as Code (CDKTF).
- **[Python Monitor Client](docs/CLIENT_PYTHON.md)**: Guide for the desktop application that captures screen content and OCR.
- **[VBA PowerPoint Client](docs/CLIENT_VBA.md)**: Guide for the PowerPoint integration that pushes slide notes.
- **[Admin Tools & Caching](docs/ADMIN_TOOLS.md)**: Explanation of the content-based caching strategy and admin scripts.

### ✨ New in this version:

- **Multi-language support**: Now includes English, Mandarin, and Cantonese Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- **Course-level configuration**: Manage languages, voices, and content caching per course.
  - See [Admin Tools & Caching](docs/ADMIN_TOOLS.md) for how to set up courses.
  - See [VBA PowerPoint Client](docs/CLIENT_VBA.md) for how to configure your presentations with a `CourseID`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Unified Deployment

The entire system, including backend infrastructure (via CDKTF) and the frontend web client (to Firebase Hosting), can be deployed with a single command.

1.  Navigate to `backend/cdktf`.
2.  Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your GCP credentials, project IDs, and API keys. This `.env` file is now the **single source of truth** for all environment-specific configurations.
3.  From the project root directory, run the unified deployment script:

    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```

This script will:
-   Provision your Google Cloud infrastructure (Cloud Functions, API Gateway, etc.) using CDKTF.
-   Update local configuration files (`backend/admin_tools/config.py`, `backend/presentation-preloader/config.py`) and test environment variables (`backend/tests/.env.test`) from the CDKTF outputs and your `.env` file.
-   Build and deploy the `client/web-student` application to Firebase Hosting.

See [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive instructions and troubleshooting.

### 2. Setup Admin Tools & Create a Course

After running `./deploy.sh`, set up the admin tools and create a demo course:

```bash
cd backend/admin_tools

# Setup Python environment and authenticate
./setup.sh

# Create a demo course
python manage_courses.py update --id "demo" --title "Demo Course" --langs "en-US,zh-CN,yue-HK"

# Create an API key for a digital human
python create_api_key.py 12345678 "Cyrus"
```

See [Admin Tools & Caching](docs/ADMIN_TOOLS.md) for more details.

### 3. Client Setup

#### Python Window Monitor
Captures your screen content to provide visual context to the AI.

```bash
cd client/python
python setup.py
# Activate venv
python window_monitor.py
```

See [Python Monitor Docs](docs/CLIENT_PYTHON.md).

#### PowerPoint Integration (VBA)
Pushes speaker notes to the AI as you navigate slides.

1.  Open your presentation in PowerPoint.
2.  Import the VBA files from `client/vba`.
3.  Add your API Key to `api_config.txt`.

See [VBA Client Docs](docs/CLIENT_VBA.md).

## 🧪 Testing

Run the backend integration tests:

```bash
cd backend/tests
./run_tests.sh
```

The `run_tests.sh` script will automatically sync configurations (including generating `.env.test`) before running pytest.
