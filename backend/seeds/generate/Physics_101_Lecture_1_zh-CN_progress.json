Note that the current deck consists of placeholder slides.\n\n**Global Context**\n\n1.  **The Narrative Arc:** The presentation follows a linear, chronological structure, progressing sequentially from Slide 1 to Slide 6. As the slides currently contain only placeholder titles without specific content, text, or visuals, the specific storyline (Problem/Solution/Outcome) is undefined.\n2.  **Key Themes & Vocabulary:**\n    *   **Enumeration:** The primary repeating element is the sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.).\n    *   **Structure:** The visual theme is a \"Blank Canvas\" or \"Template\" style.\n3.  **Speaker Persona:** **\"The Neutral Facilitator.\"** Since the content is not yet populated, the tone is generic, structural, and devoid of emotion or specific rhetoric.\n4.  **Total Slide Count:** 6 slides."
