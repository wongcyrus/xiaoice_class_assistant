  "global_context": "Based on the images provided, here is the Global Context guide. Please note that the current slides appear to be placeholders containing only slide numbers, so the analysis reflects this structural state.\n\n**1. The Narrative Arc**\nThe presentation follows a linear, sequential structure consisting of 6 distinct steps. Currently, the deck acts as a skeleton or template, progressing chronologically from \"Slide 1\" to \"Slide 6\" without specific content, arguments, or data points to define a story flow.\n\n**2. Key Themes & Vocabulary**\n*   **Sequential Organization:** The only visible elements are numerical indicators.\n*   **Placeholder Structure:** The consistent formatting suggests a blank canvas ready for content insertion.\n\n**3. Speaker Persona**\n*   **Neutral / Administrative:** Due to the lack of specific text or imagery, the tone is currently undefined and functional. Once content is added, this persona should be updated to reflect the specific subject matter.\n\n**4. Total Slide Count**\n6 Slides"
